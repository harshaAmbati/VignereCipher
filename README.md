# VignereCipher
A java based project to crack Vignere cipher using cryptography techniques

This code can crack vignere ciphers that are decrypted in different languages:

<b>The code works as follow:</b></br>
First user need to upload any of the above or all of the above language files to store in the program. </br>
Then user needs to upload any text that is encrypted using Vignere cipher technique in any unknown language.</br>
The key length ranges from 1 to 100.</br>
Finally the cracked decrypted message is then printed with its original language and a key that has used to encrypt it.</br>
